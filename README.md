The busy beaver problem is a fun theoretical computer science problem. Intuitively, the problem is to find the smallest program that outputs as many data as possible and eventually halts. More formally it goes like this â€“ given an n-state Turing Machine with a two symbol alphabet {0, 1}, what is the maximum number of 1's that the machine can print on an initially blank tape (filled with 0's) before halting?
